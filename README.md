# Project2Context

Generates a structured overview of your project for AI context. The script scans your codebase and creates a single file containing your project's structure and content, making it easy to provide context to Large Language Models.

## Usage

1. Place `project2context.py` in your project's root directory
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python project2context.py
   ```
3. Find the generated `project-context.txt` in your project root

## Configuration

Edit these sets at the start of the script to customize:
- `EXCLUDED_DIRS`: Directories to skip (e.g., node_modules)
- `EXCLUDED_FILES`: Specific files to ignore
- `TEXT_EXTENSIONS`: File types to include
- `EXCLUDED_EXTENSIONS`: File types to skip

## Output

The script generates `project-context.txt` containing:
- Directory tree structure
- Content of all text files
